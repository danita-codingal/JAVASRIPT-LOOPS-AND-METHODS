    <H1>SWITCH STATEMENT IN JAVASCRIPT</H1>
    <h4>In this activity, learn about the switch statement and how it is useful in JS</h4>
    <p>The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. It is
similar to a series of if...else statements but is more concise and easier to read when you have multiple conditions to check.</p>
    <p>Here is the syntax of a switch statement:</p>
    <pre><code>
        switch(expression) {
            case value1:
                // code to be executed if expression === value1
                break;
            case value2:
                // code to be executed if expression === value2
                break;
            ...
            default:
                // code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
        }
    </code></pre>
    <p>Example of a switch statement:</p>
    <pre><code>
        <script>
            var day = new Date().getDay();
            switch(day) {
                case 0:
                    document.write("Today is Sunday");
                    break;
                case 1:
                    document.write("Today is Monday");
                    break;
                case 2:
                    document.write("Today is Tuesday");
                    break;
                case 3:
                    document.write("Today is Wednesday");
                    break;
                case 4:
                    document.write("Today is Thursday");
                    break;
                case 5:
                    document.write("Today is Friday");
                    break;
                case 6:
                    document.write("Today is Saturday");
                    break;
                default:
                    document.write("Invalid day");
            }
        </script>
    </code></pre>
